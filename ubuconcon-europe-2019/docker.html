# What's All The Fuss About

<!-- TODO: update this image-->

.center[
<img alt="Docker on Google Trends" src="img/docker_trends.png" width="600">
]

]

???

- Increasingly being used
  - Many open source projects are Docker ready<br>
    (very simple to setup as I'm going to show further)
  - eg: mysql/postgres, apache/nginx, memcached/redis, wordpress,...

# What Docker IS

- A <u>**tool**</u> for creating and manage containers and images
- FLOSS (the community-edition)
- Able to run on Linux, MacOS\* and Windows\*
- Lightweight and fast
- Great for microservices
- Both for Devs and SysAdmins (fully DevOps)

]

???

- Easy tool that manages containers\*, images (containers templates) and everything around it (networking, storage, processes isolation)
- FLOSS - Free/Libre Open Source Software (there are community and enterprise edition)
- Easy images integration (either official and community images)

- Able to run on Linux, MacOS and Windows
  - Linux: docker-ce
  - \*MacOS, \*Windows: Docker Desktop
  - Windows applications must run in Windows hosts

- ? How much time for a new member from zero to fully ready dev environment ?
- Devs may have a fully dev ready workstation in minutes, not hours (installing docker included)
- It's a "documentation" for Devs and SysAdmins

--

.right-column[

# What Docker is NOT

- not Virtual Machine
- not Intended to be used as a VM (but may be)
- not Intended to be used as a regular server
- not Magic that solves all your problems
- not Tool for everything 

]

???

-------

- the Container runs on the same kernel as the host.
- Do not use it as a VM:
  - don't ssh into it
  - don't tweak a runnning container
- Do not use it as a regular server
  - Don't install every application/software inside one container
  - Think about application isolation: one (micro)service per container
- It's not magic. Although mostly easy, you need some effort for non-trivial stuff
- It's a common "error" to try to fix everything with docker

---

name: tech-comparison

# Technology comparison

## Physical Server (old days)

- One server &rarr; One application
- Slow deployment times
- Huge costs
- Wasted resources
- Difficult to scale
- Difficult to migrate
- Difficult to maintain

???

Just a quick review over the history:

- Before, applications were deployed in bare metal
- We had monolitic apps, slow development, huge costs in hw maintenance
- Everything was difficult: scale, migrate, maintain

---

# Technology comparison

## Hypervisor Virtualization (modern days)

.left-column[

- Better resource pooling
- Easier to scale
- Cloud support
- Elasticity
- Pay as you go

] .right-column[

- Resources allocation
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - Storage
  - Operating System
- More applications &rarr; More resources (~linear growth)

]

???

- VM are better
- But still a problem with wasted resources
  - More applications => more resources

---

# Technology comparison

## Containers (Future)

- Better resource management
- Faster
- Lighter / Storage requirements
- Faster to scale
- Security

???

- It's not just future, it is already here.
- No need to pre-alocate resources
- No need to boot the OS
- Take advantage of COW\*
- Scale like VM, but faster
- Security - no need for ssh, or other dependencies

(\* later)

---

# VM vs Container

.center[
<img alt="VM vs Container" src="img/docker_vs_vm.svg" width=800>
]


???

- The lack of Guest OS enables
  - Faster boot up
  - Less resources: CPU/RAM/Storage
  - Better resource management

---

name: pros-and-cons

# Docker Pros & Cons

.left-column[

## Pros

- Easy to get started
- Great community & Widely used
- Portable
- Light and fast
- Works on Linux + MacOS + Windows
- Works as documentation
- Easy to install dependencies
- COW: Copy-On-Write

]

???

- really easy. If you don't know yet, you will know in the end
- Docker has become a standard in the container insdustry and beyond
  - Lots of software support docker (as a quick start/installation)- just use git
- Portable for devs and ops:
  - just share your dockerfile. No need to copy the whole VM (yeah, you can use vagrant. Try docker with vagrant if you may)
  - Portable: if I want to move to AWS, Azure, etc... it's easy(ier)
- only the service running. No OS
- bootup in seconds, no OS bootup
- Need a mysql? There is an image for that. Postgres, Redis, Memcached, Mongo......
- COW: running 10 similar containers does not need 10x the storage. more on that later

--

.right-column[

## Cons

- Not all applications benefit from containers
- Not bare-metal performance
- Persistent data storage
- Graphical applications don't work well

]

???

- like production database
- not useful for super-mainframe-single_unit-legacy-very_important-performance_sensitive service
- persistence storage is achieved with volumes
- But this Cons are usually irrelevant for most use cases

# The Basics

]

???

Let's check/review what are containers and images

---

name: containers

# Docker container

"A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another"

???

- citation from docker website
- So what does this means?

--

- Contains all software dependencies
- Applicational isolation
- Runs directly on the kernel
- Instance of Docker Image

???

- no need to install any dependency on the host
- A docker host may have multiple containers, unaware and isolated of each other
- may be compared with the old 'portable software' vs 'regular installed software'

---

name: images

# Docker image

"A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."

???

- citation from docker website
- So what does this means?

--

- Template for running a container
- Referenced list of layers
- Layer: a list of changes to the filesystem
- Immutable

???

- An image does not run, only a container does so
- layers: more on that later
- immutable: every change on a running container is not stored on the image

---

name: dockerfile

# Dockerfile

.left-column[

- Blueprint of a Docker Image
- Text file
- List of ordered instructions (commands)
- Documentation

]

???

one last Basic

- It's the instructions for building an image
- It's just a text file
- with instructions
- Also states as documentation
- layer cache later

--

.right-column[

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update           <red>!!!</red>
RUN apt-get install cowsay   <red>!!!</red>

CMD ["cowsay", "Hello world"]

```

]

???

- **DISCLAIMER**: For those who know docker already, I will fix this later
- As you can see, it's just text file
- Each command (FROM, RUN) creates a layer
- First command is **FROM** (mandatory). It is the base template for our image
- More commands later

# Install Docker

- Do NOT install from apt-get: very outdated (almost useless)
- Windows - Docker Desktop
  - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
- Mac - Docker Desktop
  - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
- Linux
  - Brain dead easy way: `wget -qO- https://get.docker.com | sh`
  - Other way: https://docs.docker.com/install/

Recommended for Linux: Manage Docker as a non-root user (https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)

???

- Don't install from your regular app management. It's almost useless
- Windows/Mac: Docker Desktop
- Linux
  - just use the script or
  - do it manually by following the docs (still not hard)

# Persistence

]

---

name: volumes

# Volumes

- Persisting data
- Sharing data between containers
- Types
  - Bind mounts (`docker run -v /path-on-host:/data`)
  - Named volume (`docker run -v vol_name:/data`)
  - Tmpfs (not persistent)
  - Other volumes - driver_opts (eg: NFS)

???

- Docker containers do not persist data once removed
- The same volume may be used by multiple containers, allowing sharing files
- Bind mount: specific path on the host is mounted to the container
- Named volume: still mounted from host to container, but managed by docker
- tmpfs: memory only
- Other volumes: NFS
