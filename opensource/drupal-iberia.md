# The Power of Open Source

- **Freedom**: Control your software, data, and digital future
- **Data Sovereignty**: Own and control your data, not big tech
- **Transparency**: Open code means trust and security
- **Ethical AI**: Open models promote transparency and help prevent biased, proprietary systems
- **Innovation**: Faster progress through shared knowledge
- **Impact**: From personal projects to enterprise solutions
- **Collaboration**: Global communities building together

???

### The four essential freedoms
A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms: [1]

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

# But Open Source is Getting Broken

- **Corporate Control**: Corporations steering projects for profit
- **Sustainability Challenges**: Funding and resource scarcity
- **Fragmentation**: Lack of unified direction in some projects
- **Lack of Governance**: Inconsistent decision-making processes
- **Contributor Burnout**: Volunteers overwhelmed and under-supported
- **Abandonment**: Key projects being neglected or discontinued

- **Giving Back**: Itâ€™s a chance to contribute to something larger than yourself
